The file ImportBatchLoadTester.js can be used to run one-of load tests of the ImageService.
The tester uses node-config for configuration, and sample configuration files can be found under
config: couch_load_test.js and touch_load_test.js

- When using CouchDB, the test will automatically create/destroy a db before/after each run.  When
- When using TouchDB the setup/teardown of the db  has to be done manually.

To run:

- in ImageService/config:

  $ ln -s touch_load_test.js [your-host-name].js
  (or couch_load_test.js as the case may be).

  edit touch_load_test.js to suit your needs.  You can set the 
  importPath/genCheckSums/numJobs parameters there.

- If using TouchDb, Start MediaManagerTouchServer with the name of whatever db you want to test with

- Run the test

  $ mocha test/ImportBatchLoadTester.js

- If using TouchDb, Manually remove the db files from the filesystem if you want to create a new
  test from scratch on the next run.
